# The domain of a function is the set of arguments it can take.

# HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
# Functions that manipulate functions are called higher-order functions.


# Lexical scope. Locally defined functions also have access to the name bindings in the scope in which they are defined.

# RECURSION 

# A function is called recursive if the body of the function calls the function itself, either directly or indirectly. 


# Recursive functions generally have a base case or multiply base cases
# Recursive calls always have a certain character: they simplify the original problem. 
# Recursive functions express computation by simplifying problems incrementally
