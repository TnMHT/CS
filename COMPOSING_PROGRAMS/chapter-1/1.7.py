#  Recursive Functions


# RECURSION 

# A function is called recursive if the body of the function calls the function itself, either directly or indirectly. 


# Recursive functions generally have a base case or multiply base cases
# Recursive calls always have a certain character: they simplify the original problem. 
# Recursive functions express computation by simplifying problems incrementally
