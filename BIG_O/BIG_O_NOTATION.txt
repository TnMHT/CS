NOTES ON BIG O NOTATION

Big O asymptotic analysis

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior 
of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or declines.


What is good code?
1. Readable
2. Scalable = Speed & Memory

3 Pillars of Programming
1. Readable
2. Speed - Time Complexity
3. Memory - Space Complexity

When we grow bigger and bigger with our input, how much does our output slow down?
Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs --- Choose the right ones!

// Space Complexity
Heap = Where we store variables and values that we assign
Stack = Where we keep track of our function calls
What causes space complexity?
Variables, Data Structures, Function Calls, Allocations.

//  O(n)
Linear Time.
N depends on the number of inputs.
As the number elements increase the number of operations increase.

//  O(1)
Constant Time.
No matter how many inputs there is the number of operatations is 1.

//  O(n^2)
Quadratic Time.
Every time the number of elements increase, the number of operations increases significantly.

// O(n!)
Factorial Time.
Nested Loop for every input. Terrible. Rare.


// Simplify Big O
Rule 1: Worst Case
Rule 2: Remove Constants
Rule 3: Different Terms for Inputs
Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants
