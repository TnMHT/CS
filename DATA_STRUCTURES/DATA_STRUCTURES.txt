NOTES ON DATA STRUCTURES

What is a Data Structure?
Data Structures are collections of values. Each one is good for a specific use case.
Ways to hold and organize information.
Tradeoffs with different operations. IE. Traverse, Search, Sort, Assecc, Insert, Delete



How Computers Store Data.
CPU - BRAIN - Needs access to ram and storage
RAM - RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY - Shelf that registers all the bits and bytes like an address book
STORAGE - PERSISTANCE - Holds files



DATA STRUCTURE TYPES

ARRAYS
STACKS
QUEUES
LINKED LISTS
TREES
TRIES
GRAPHS
HASH MAPS



// ARRAYS

Organizes items sequantially 
STATIC ARRAYS = Fixed in size, declared before hand.
DYNAMIC ARRAYS = Copy and rebuild arrays in a new location.

Javascript automatically resizes arrays. Tradeoff is speed and efficiency.

Arrays are good for fat look ups, push and pops, ordered.
Bad for slow inserts, slow deletes, and fized size if array is static


// HASH TABLES
